Gas Mileage Calculator (Back End)
=================================
Introduction
------------
When my father passed away, I inherited his 2002 Ford F-150 pickup truck. It's a
beast, with a 5.4L V8 engine. It sucks gas. A LOT of gas. But, I've never been
able to accurately calculate how much I'm spending nor what the effective gas
mileage is without some effort. This app is designed to remedy that.

It's a running gas mileage calculator. The user enters in their odometer reading,
the amount of gas they purchased at their last fill up, and, optionally, the amount
of the purchase. The app then calculates the average mileage and average cost, per
gallon.

For notes about the Client, please see the README [here](https://github.com/gbbenson68/gas-mileage-calculator-client).

Technologies Used
-----------------
The web application back end was written utilizing and with the help of the following technologies:

About Me
--------
I am an aerospace engineer by education and a software engineer by experience. Iâ€™ve always been intrigued by using software to solve practical problems, whether it be something as simple as providing an HTML interface for viewing invoices or something as complex as modeling the fluid flow through a rocket thruster. I recently decided to upgrade my skill set with an immersive software engineering program at General Assembly, and I am now taking my ambitions to the next level. I am eager and excited to take on those sometimes seemingly unsurmountable challenges regarding major problems that affect all of our society, and am especially interested in those problems affecting the underprivileged.
